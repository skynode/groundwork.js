## Get it

### CDN Versions

**Production** (minified)

```
https://cdn.thegroundwork.com/groundworkjs/1.1.0/groundwork.min.js
```

**Development** (additional logging)

```
https://cdn.thegroundwork.com/groundworkjs/1.1.0/groundwork.js
```

### Stand-alone

Check out the repository and build a stand-alone distributable:

```shell
$ npm install
$ npm run dist
```

The compiled files will be in the `/dist` folder.

## Documentation and Examples

You can read the API documentation for the client itself [here](https://cdn.thegroundwork.com/groundworkjs/doc/).

There are some examples of the client itself [here](https://cdn.thegroundwork.com/groundworkjs/examples/).

## Usage

```javascript
import Groundwork from 'groundwork.js';

// Create a new Groundwork client using your client id
let gw = new Groundwork({
  'apiKey': 'abc123'
});

// Collect user information from a form
let signUpData = {
  email: form.emailAddress,
  givenName: form.firstName,
  familyName: form.lastName,
  phone: form.phone,
  postalCode: form.postalCode,
  source: "form_frontpage_campaignXYZ"
};

let handleSuccess = function(res) { /* Handle successful signup */}
let handleErrors = function(err) { /* Handle error during signup */}

// Create a new supporter using the collected data and handle success or error states
gw.supporter.create(signUpData)
  .then(handleSuccess)
  .catch(handleErrors);
```
## Browser requirements

A+ Grade browsers

## Prerequisites

Before working with the library source, you'll need to install some reqiured packages:

```shell
npm install
```

## Build

To build a standalone library file and documentation:

```shell
npm run dist
```

This will create a minified and non-minified file in `dist` and updated documentation will be in `doc`. Note: when making a release (see below) the `dist` files are built and pushed up for you.

## Documentation

Documentation is generated using [ESDoc](https://esdoc.org/):

```shell
npm run docs
```

## Development

This library is written in [ES2015](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/) and compiled to [ES5](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/) via [Babel](https://babeljs.io). Tests are written with Jasmine and run with Karma.

This project uses [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html) ([longer explanation](http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html)) as a deployment model. Please make feature branches from `master` and then PR them for review.

**Setup your environment:**

You need [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed.

```shell
npm install
```

**Run the development environment:**

```shell
npm run dev
```

A compiled `groundwork.js` is served from [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

**Run the examples:**

```shell
npm run examples
```

This will rewrite the files in `/examples` to use the current locally compiled version of `groundwork.js` instead of the CDN version. Useful for testing your work in an HTML page. The files are served from [localhost:3030](http://localhost:3030)

**Run the tests:**

```shell
npm test # starts a watcher that runs automated tests in multiple browsers
npm run test-ci # runs automated tests in PhantomJS & Firefox just once
```

There are an additional set of integration tests which hit the live Dev API. These should only be run if:

1. You have access to the dev environment
1. You don't mind waiting for live requests to go through

To run them, copy the contents of `/integration_test` into `/test` and then run `npm run test-phantom`. You will get some fails from existing tests during this run.

**Make a release:**

Once you have a working release ready to go it needs to be tagged. Update the `version` property in `package.json` and commit the file. Then run the release script:

```shell
npm run release
```

This will create a tag with the version number, build the `dist` files and push them up to the repo.
